<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Let's be honest, the vsfs timetables are not the best, atleast in my opinion. Soo, I made an app for displying my timetables.

I find the website timetable very chaotic and poorly designed. My app is not much better, but I think it does better job at displaying it.
Also keep in mind that this app is build only for Applied Infromatics timetable and I have absolutely no idea what happens if you have different timetables.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## App Features

At this moment the app is still in development, that said, it has some nice features.
You no longer have to keep in mind if it's even or odd week. My app does that for you and displays you the proper timetable for the week.
In progress classes are highlighted so you can check immediately where to go! Duration of every subject is also mentioned in the timetable.
I also made sure to make a simple keep signed in feature, so you don't have to log in every time.

<!-- GETTING STARTED / INSTALATION -->
## Getting Started / Installation

You can either build the app for yourself or you can download it <a href="https://github.com/EmkoCZ/VSFS/releases/tag/V1.1.5">here for Android</a>.<br>
Minimum Android version is **5.0**. <br>
If you want this app on **IOS**, you'll have to compile it yourself since I do not own a mac. All needed code is here, so feel free to do so.

<!-- UPDATING -->
## Updating the app

Once a new version comes out, all you need to do is download the apk file and open it. Your phone will ask you if you want to update the app, just click yes
and that's it!

<!-- SECURITY -->
## Security - Password and Username

Is it safe to use this app? When it comes to sending the username and password, it's the same as if you were to log in using a web client. I simply use GET
request to get the data, so the communication between you and the server is pretty much the same. The password has Base64 encryption. (That's what the website uses)
**Keep me signed in feature saves your login info into your phone.**

<!-- LIST -->
## List of informations

Here's what you can read from my timetable:
* Subject code (So you can see if it's a lection or an exercise)
* Subject name
* Teacher's name
* Classroom
* Time

<!-- NEW FEATURES -->
## Will I add more features?

Maybe, I probably want to add at least one more feature which is callendar. Then try to optimize the app a little bit more and that'll be probs it.
I might update some features meanwhile.
