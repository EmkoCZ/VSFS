<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Let's be honest, the vsfs timetables are not the best, so I made my own app to display timetables for my fiel of study.

I find the website timetable very chaotic and poorly designed. My app is not much better, but I think it does better job at displaying it.

## App Features

At this moment the app is still in development, that said, it has some nice features.
You no longer have to keep in mind if it's even or odd week. My app does that for you and displays you the proper timetable for the week.
In progress classes are highlighted so you can check immediately where to go! Duration of every subject is also mentioned in the timetable.
I also made sure to make a simple keep signed in feature, so you don't have to log in every time.

<!-- SECURITY -->
## Security - Password and Username

Is it safe to use this app? When it comes to sending the username and password, it's the same as if you were to log in using a web client. I simply use GET
request to get the data, so the communication between you and the server is pretty much the same. The password has Base64 encryption. (That's what the website uses)
**Keep me signed in feature saves your login info into your phone.**
